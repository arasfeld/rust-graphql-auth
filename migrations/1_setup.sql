-- This extension gives us `uuid_generate_v1mc()` which generates UUIDs that cluster better than `gen_random_uuid()`
-- while still being difficult to predict and enumerate.
-- Also, while unlikely, `gen_random_uuid()` can in theory produce collisions which can trigger spurious errors on
-- insertion, whereas it's much less likely with `uuid_generate_v1mc()`.
